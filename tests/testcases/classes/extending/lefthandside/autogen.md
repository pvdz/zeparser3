> LeftHandSideExpression :

> - CallExpression
>   - Async call (not arrow!)
>   - Super call
>   - Dynamic import
>   - Recursive with a tail (call args, dynamic property access, dot property access, tagged template)
> - NewExpression
>   - Recursive; new NewExpression
>   - Recursive with a tail (dynamic property access, dot property access, tagged template)
>   - Super property
>   - new.target
>   - PrimaryExpression
>     - Identifier (including `this`)
>     - Literal (strings, numbers, true, false, null, regex, template)
>     - Array
>     - Object
>     - Any kind of function expression
>     - Class expression
>     - ParenthesizedExpression
>
> Notable exceptions:
>
> - `await` and `yield`
> - arrows
> - operators (assignment / binary / update)
> - most unary operators (only `new` is allowed)
> - sequence expression (comma) without group
>
> In other words, it mainly outlaws almost any unary expression and any arrow expression. The other things can be prevented by simply parsing a value without further ops and by not calling parseExpressions (plural). Until the spec changes, of course.


## Input

One test file is generated for each combination of input case and input template. The `#` in the template is replaced with the input case.
