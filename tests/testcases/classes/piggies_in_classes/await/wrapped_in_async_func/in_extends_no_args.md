# ZeParser parser test case

> Extends ("ClassHeritage") is expecting a "LeftHandSideExpression" which is a production that does not lead to an `await` expression. Under an `async` function the name "await" can also not be a binding name so it must be an error.

## FAIL

## Input

`````js
async function f() {   class x extends await { }   }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  An `await` expression is not allowed here

async function f() {   class x extends await { }   }
                                       ^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
