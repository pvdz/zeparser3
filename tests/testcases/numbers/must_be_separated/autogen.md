### Templates

#### Valid base

`````js
# in x
`````

#### Invalid with in

## FAIL

`````js
#in y
`````

#### Invalid with instanceof

## FAIL

`````js
#instanceof x
`````

#### Trailing zero

Probably not an error in most examples, just a trailing zero

## FAIL

`````js
#0
`````

#### Trailing 9

Not an error in most cases where 9 is a valid digit, but binary/octal should reject it.

## FAIL

`````js
#9
`````

#### Semi

`````js
#;
`````

#### Blocked

(ASI?)

`````js
{#}
