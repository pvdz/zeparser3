> :: case: 6

## Input

- ``es = 6`

`````js
try {} catch {}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'TryStatement',
      block: { type: 'BlockStatement', body: [] },
      handler: {
        type: 'CatchClause',
        param: null,
        body: { type: 'BlockStatement', body: [] }
      },
      finalizer: null
    }
  ]
}

tokens (7x):
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
