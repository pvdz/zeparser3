> :: test: cannot use as binding destruct
> :: case: await

## Input


`````js
const {await} = x;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'VariableDeclaration',
      kind: 'const',
      declarations: [
        {
          type: 'VariableDeclarator',
          id: {
            type: 'ObjectPattern',
            properties: [
              {
                type: 'Property',
                key: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'await' },
                kind: 'init',
                method: false,
                computed: false,
                value: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'await' },
                shorthand: true
              }
            ]
          },
          init: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' }
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}

tokens (8x):
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (await) as a variable name because: Await is illegal outside of async body with module goal

const {await} = x;
            ^------- error
`````


### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
