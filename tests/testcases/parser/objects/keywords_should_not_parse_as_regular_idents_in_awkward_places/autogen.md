These cases are automatically extrapolated and written to their own file.
Each case is applied to each test by simply replacing `#` with the actual case.

### Templates

#### destructuring assignment as shorthand

`````js
({#} = x);
`````

#### destructuring assignment as property value

property is valid assignment target so should work

`````js
({x: #} = x);
`````

#### in object as shorthand

`````js
({#});
`````

#### in object as value

`````js
({x: #});
`````

#### in arrow head as shorthand

`````js
({#}) => x;
`````

#### in arrow head as alias

`````js
({x: #}) => x;
`````
