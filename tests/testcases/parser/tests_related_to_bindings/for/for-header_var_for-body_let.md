## Input

`````js
for (var a;;) { let a; }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ForStatement',
      init: {
        type: 'VariableDeclaration',
        kind: 'var',
        declarations: [
          {
            type: 'VariableDeclarator',
            id: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'a' },
            init: null
          }
        ]
      },
      test: null,
      update: null,
      body: {
        type: 'BlockStatement',
        body: [
          {
            type: 'VariableDeclaration',
            kind: 'let',
            declarations: [
              {
                type: 'VariableDeclarator',
                id: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'a' },
                init: null
              }
            ]
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (13x):
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
       PUNCTUATOR IDENT IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
