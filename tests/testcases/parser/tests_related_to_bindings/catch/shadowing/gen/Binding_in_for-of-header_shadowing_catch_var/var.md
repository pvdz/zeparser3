>
> :: case: var

## Input


`````js
try {} catch (e) { for (var e of y) {} }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Can not redefine the catch-var `e` as same binding

try {} catch (e) { for (var e of y) {} }
                            ^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Encountered `var` declaration for a name used in catch binding which in web compat mode is still not allowed in a `for-of`

try {} catch (e) { for (var e of y) {} }
                              ^------- error
`````
