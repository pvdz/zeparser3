## Input

`````js
function f(){} function f(){}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'FunctionDeclaration',
      generator: false,
      async: false,
      id: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'f' },
      params: [],
      body: { type: 'BlockStatement', body: [] }
    },
    {
      type: 'FunctionDeclaration',
      generator: false,
      async: false,
      id: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'f' },
      params: [],
      body: { type: 'BlockStatement', body: [] }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (13x):
       IDENT IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot create lexical binding when the name was already bound

function f(){} function f(){}
                        ^------- error
`````


### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
