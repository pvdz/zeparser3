@A 2028 is considered a newline but at the same time a string can't contain newlines.
However, the actual rule is:
https://tc39.es/ecma262/#sec-literals-string-literals
> All code points may appear literally in a string literal except for the closing quote code points, U+005C (REVERSE SOLIDUS), U+000D (CARRIAGE RETURN), and U+000A (LINE FEED).
This was a regression caught by test262
Note that https://tc39.es/ecma262/#prod-DoubleStringCharacter explicitly allows PS and LS in the single/double string productions.
