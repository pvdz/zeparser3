what about `for ([x]=y in z);`, is that an exception? would it break if we can assignment exprs in lhs?
(In the context of patterns with trailing init not being assignments)

lhs can not use paren trick to avoid non-assignability (https://tc39.github.io/ecma262/#sec-for-in-and-for-of-statements-static-semantics-early-errors)

can not use `for (let[foo] as bar);` to refer to `let` as a varname. Similarly I don't think `for (let[foo].bar` is allowed (although it doesn't get the same explicit exception as statements).
