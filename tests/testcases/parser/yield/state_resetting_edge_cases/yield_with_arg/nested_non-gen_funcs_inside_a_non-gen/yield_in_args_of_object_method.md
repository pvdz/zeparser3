## Input


`````js
function f(){  x = {foo(a=yield x){}}  }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Next ord should be 41 (`)`) but was 120 (curc: `x`, token: `x`)

function f(){  x = {foo(a=yield x){}}  }
                                ^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use `yield` outside of generator functions when in strict mode

function f(){  x = {foo(a=yield x){}}  }
                                ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
