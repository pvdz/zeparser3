These cases are automatically extrapolated and written to their own file.
Each case is applied to each test by simply replacing `#` with the actual case.

## Input

### Cases


> `````js
> a
> `````

Note: the character value of \b in char classes is 8 (the backspace). so a-\b is error.

> `````js
> b
> `````

Note: \B (etc) is legal in ranges in webcompat as long as there is no u-flag

> `````js
> B
> `````

The character value of an unqualified \c (with no param) is the backslash! Not the `c`
So a-\c is bad where A-\c is good (backslash sits between lower and upper case)

> `````js
> c
> `````
