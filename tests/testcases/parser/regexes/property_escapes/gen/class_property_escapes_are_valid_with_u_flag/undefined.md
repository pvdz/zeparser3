# ZeParser parser autogenerated test case

- Path: zeparser3/tests/testcases/parser/regexes/property_escapes/gen/class_property_escapes_are_valid_with_u_flag

> :: test: class property escapes are valid with u flag
> :: case: undefined

## Input

- `es = undefined`

`````js
\p{x}b]/u
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    Only unicode escapes are supported in identifier escapes

\p{x}b]/u
^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
