## Input

- `es = 8`

`````js
/a\p{x}b/u
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    Encountered unescaped closing curly `}` while not parsing a quantifier

/a\p{x}b/u
^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    Regex had syntax that is invalid with u-flag and u-flag was in fact present

/a\p{x}b/u
^------- error
`````
