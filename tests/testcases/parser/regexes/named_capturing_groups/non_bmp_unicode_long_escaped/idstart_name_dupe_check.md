## FAIL

## Input

`````js
/(?<\u{2F9DF}>foo)met\k<\ud87e\udddf>/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    The es6 long unicode escape is only valid with u-flag; Encountered extended unicode escape `\u{}` which is only valid with u-flag but this regex is invalid with u-flag

/(?<\u{2F9DF}>foo)met\k<\ud87e\udddf>/
^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
