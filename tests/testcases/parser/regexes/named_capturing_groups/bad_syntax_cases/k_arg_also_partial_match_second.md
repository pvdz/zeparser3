> This catches a regression where the first char of the group was omitted and so the original test case would still pass since it would record `ab` as `b` and then check group `a`. So this test checks group `b` for `ab` and if the first char is still omitted then it would pass, where it should fail.

## Input

`````js
/(?<ab>a)\k<b>/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    Named back reference \k<b> was not defined in this regex: {#ab:true}

/(?<ab>a)\k<b>/
^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.
