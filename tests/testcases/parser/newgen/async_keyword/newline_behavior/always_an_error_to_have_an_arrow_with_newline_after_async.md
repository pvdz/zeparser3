> ::> always an error to have an arrow with newline after async

## Input

`````js
async 
 () => x,foo + async 
 () => x,return async 
 () => x,break async 
 () => x,var x = async 
 () => x, y,let x = async 
 () => x, y,const x = async 
 () => x, y,export async 
 () => x,(async 
 () => x),[async 
 () => x],{x: async 
 () => x},x[async 
 () => x],x(async 
 () => x),function f(x = async 
 () => x){},`${async 
 () => x}`,do async 
 () => x while (x);,if (async 
 () => x) x,try {} catch(e = async 
 () => x) {},if (x) async 
 () => x else y,class x extends async 
 () => x {}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  A newline after async is always a syntax error if the rhs turns to be an arrow function

async 
 () => x,foo + async 
    ^------- error

 () => x,return async 
 () => x,break async 
 () => x,var x = async 
 () => x, y,let x = async 
 () => x, y,const x = async 
 () => x, y,export async 
 () => x,(async 
 ()
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
