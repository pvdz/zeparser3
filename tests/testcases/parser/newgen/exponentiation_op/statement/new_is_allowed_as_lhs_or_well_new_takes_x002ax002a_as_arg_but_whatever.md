## Input

`````js
new x ** 2;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      expression: {
        type: 'BinaryExpression',
        left: {
          type: 'NewExpression',
          arguments: [],
          callee: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' }
        },
        operator: '**',
        right: { type: 'Literal', value: 2, raw: '2' }
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (6x):
       IDENT IDENT PUNCTUATOR NUMBER_DEC PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
