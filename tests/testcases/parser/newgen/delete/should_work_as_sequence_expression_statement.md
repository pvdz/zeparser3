## Input

`````js
delete foo.bar, z;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      expression: {
        type: 'SequenceExpression',
        expressions: [
          {
            type: 'UnaryExpression',
            operator: 'delete',
            prefix: true,
            argument: {
              type: 'MemberExpression',
              object: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'foo' },
              property: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'bar' },
              computed: false
            }
          },
          { type: 'Identifier', name: 'z' }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (8x):
       IDENT IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
