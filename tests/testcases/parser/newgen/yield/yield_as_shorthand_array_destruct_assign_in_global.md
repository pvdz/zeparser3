## Input

`````js
([yield] = x)
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      expression: {
        type: 'AssignmentExpression',
        left: {
          type: 'ArrayPattern',
          elements: [ { type: 'Identifier', name: 'yield' } ]
        },
        operator: '=',
        right: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' }
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (9x):
       PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT
       PUNCTUATOR ASI
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use `yield` outside of generator functions when in strict mode

([yield] = x)
       ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
