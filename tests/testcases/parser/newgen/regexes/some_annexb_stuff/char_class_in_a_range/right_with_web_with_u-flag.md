## Input


`````js
/[a-\d]+/u
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Tokenizer error: Regex: Range error with u-flag and unknown reason why regex is invalid without u-flag so it cannot be a valid regex

/[a-\d]+/u
^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Tokenizer error: Regex: Regex had syntax that is invalid with u-flag and flag was in fact present

/[a-\d]+/u
^------- error
`````
