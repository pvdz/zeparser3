> :: regexes : property escapes : web compat : default, ES=`Infinity`
>
> ::> double property escapes sans u flag

## Input

- `es = Infinity`

`````js
/\p{Hex}\P{Hex}/
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Tokenizer error: Regex: Regex had syntax that is only valid with the u-flag and flag was in fact not present

/\p{Hex}\P{Hex}/
^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      expression: {
        type: 'Literal',
        value: null,
        regex: { pattern: '\\p{Hex}\\P{Hex}', flags: '' },
        raw: '/\\p{Hex}\\P{Hex}/'
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (3x):
       REGEX ASI
