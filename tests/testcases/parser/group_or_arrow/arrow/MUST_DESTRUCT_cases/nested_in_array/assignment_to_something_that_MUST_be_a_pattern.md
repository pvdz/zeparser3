## Input

`````js
([{x = y}] = z)
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      expression: {
        type: 'AssignmentExpression',
        left: {
          type: 'ArrayPattern',
          elements: [
            {
              type: 'ObjectPattern',
              properties: [
                {
                  type: 'Property',
                  key: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' },
                  kind: 'init',
                  method: false,
                  computed: false,
                  value: {
                    type: 'AssignmentPattern',
                    left: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' },
                    right: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'y' }
                  },
                  shorthand: true
                }
              ]
            }
          ]
        },
        operator: '=',
        right: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'z' }
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (13x):
       PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT
       PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR ASI

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
