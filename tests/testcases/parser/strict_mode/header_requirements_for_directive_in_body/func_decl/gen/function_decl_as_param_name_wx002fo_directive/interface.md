> :: test: function decl; as param name w/o directive
> :: case: interface

## Input


`````js
function c(interface){ }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'FunctionDeclaration',
      generator: false,
      async: false,
      id: { type: 'Identifier', name: 'c' },
      params: [ { type: 'Identifier', name: 'interface' } ],
      body: { type: 'BlockStatement', body: [] }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (8x):
       IDENT IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (interface) as a variable name because: Cannot use this reserved word as a variable name in strict mode

function c(interface){ }
           ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
