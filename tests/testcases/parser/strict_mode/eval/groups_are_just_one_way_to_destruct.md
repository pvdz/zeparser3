# ZeParser parser test case

## Input

`````js
x, [eval] = [x]
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      expression: {
        type: 'SequenceExpression',
        expressions: [
          { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' },
          {
            type: 'AssignmentExpression',
            left: {
              type: 'ArrayPattern',
              elements: [ { type: 'Identifier', name: 'eval' } ]
            },
            operator: '=',
            right: {
              type: 'ArrayExpression',
              elements: [ { type: 'Identifier', name: 'x' } ]
            }
          }
        ]
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (11x):
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
       PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR ASI
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Tried to destructure something that is not destructible

x, [eval] = [x]
          ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
