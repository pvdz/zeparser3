## Input

`````js
for (let.foo;;);
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,col:0},end:{line:1,col:16},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ForStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,col:0},end:{line:1,col:16},source:''},
      init: {
        type: 'MemberExpression',
        loc:{start:{line:1,col:5},end:{line:1,col:12},source:''},
        object: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,col:5},end:{line:1,col:8},source:''},
          name: 'let'
        },
        property: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,col:9},end:{line:1,col:9},source:''},
          name: 'foo'
        },
        computed: false
      },
      test: null,
      update: null,
      body: {
        type: 'EmptyStatement',
        loc:{start:{line:1,col:15},end:{line:1,col:16},source:''}
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (10x):
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
       PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Let binding missing binding names

for (let.foo;;);
        ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
