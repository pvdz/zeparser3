## Input

`````js
function *f(){   (y\u0069eld "sentinal 78432")   }
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (y\u0069eld) as a variable name because: Cannot use this reserved word as a variable name inside a generator

function *f(){   (y\u0069eld "sentinal 78432")   }
                             ^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (y\u0069eld) as a variable name because: Cannot use this reserved word as a variable name in strict mode

function *f(){   (y\u0069eld "sentinal 78432")   }
                             ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
