## Input

`````js
if (x) ; else let
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'IfStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
      test: {
        type: 'Identifier',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:4},end:{line:1,column:5},source:''},
        name: 'x'
      },
      consequent: {
        type: 'EmptyStatement',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:7},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''}
      },
      alternate: {
        type: 'ExpressionStatement',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:14},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
        expression: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:14},end:{line:1,column:17},source:''},
          name: 'let'
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (9x):
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR PUNCTUATOR IDENT IDENT ASI
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  `let` declaration not allowed here and `let` cannot be a regular var or label name in strict mode (at EOF)

if (x) ; else let
              ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [sloppy]:

````js
if (x) ; else (let);
````

Produces same AST
