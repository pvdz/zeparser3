## Input

`````js
_ => let
{foo};
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:2,column:6},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'ExpressionStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
      expression: {
        type: 'ArrowFunctionExpression',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
        params: [
          {
            type: 'Identifier',
            loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:1},source:''},
            name: '_'
          }
        ],
        id: null,
        generator: false,
        async: false,
        expression: true,
        body: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:5},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
          name: 'let'
        }
      }
    },
    {
      type: 'BlockStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:2,column:0},end:{line:2,column:5},source:''},
      body: [
        {
          type: 'ExpressionStatement',
          loc:{start:{line:2,column:1},end:{line:2,column:4},source:''},
          expression: {
            type: 'Identifier',
            loc:{start:{line:2,column:1},end:{line:2,column:4},source:''},
            name: 'foo'
          }
        }
      ]
    },
    {
      type: 'EmptyStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:2,column:5},end:{line:2,column:6},source:''}
    }
  ]
}

tokens (10x):
       IDENT PUNC_EQ_GT IDENT ASI PUNC_CURLY_OPEN IDENT ASI
       PUNC_CURLY_CLOSE PUNC_SEMI
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Can not use `let` as variable name in strict mode

_ => let
{foo};
^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [sloppy]:

````js
_ => (let);
{(foo);}
;
````

Produces same AST
