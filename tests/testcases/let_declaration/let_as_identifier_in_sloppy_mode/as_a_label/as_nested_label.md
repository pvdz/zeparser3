## Input

`````js
foo: let: y;
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:12},source:''},
  body: [
    {
      type: 'LabeledStatement',
      loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:12},source:''},
      label: {
        type: 'Identifier',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:1,column:3},source:''},
        name: 'foo'
      },
      body: {
        type: 'LabeledStatement',
        loc:{start:{line:1,column:5},end:{line:1,column:12},source:''},
        label: {
          type: 'Identifier',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:5},end:{line:1,column:8},source:''},
          name: 'let'
        },
        body: {
          type: 'ExpressionStatement',
          loc:{start:{line:1,column:10},end:{line:1,column:12},source:''},
          expression: {
            type: 'Identifier',
            loc:{start:{line:1,column:10},end:{line:1,column:11},source:''},
            name: 'y'
          }
        }
      }
    }
  ]
}

tokens (7x):
       IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR IDENT PUNCTUATOR
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  `let` declaration not allowed here and `let` cannot be a regular var or label name in strict mode

foo: let: y;
        ^------- error
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
