# ZeParser parser autogenerated test case

- From: tests/testcases/import_dynamic/autogen.md
- Path: tests/testcases/import_dynamic/gen/As_arg_of_x0060newx0060/11.md

> :: import dynamic : gen : As arg of x0060newx0060
>
> ::> 11

## Input

- `es = 11`

`````js
new import(x);
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use dynamic import as an argument to `new`, the spec simply does not allow it

new import(x);
    ^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
