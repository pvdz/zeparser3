## Input


`````js
function protected(){
  for(;;) 
    switch(x){
      default:
    }
}

const protected = x, function arguments(){}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Attempted to create a lexical binding for `protected` but another binding already existed on the same level

function protected(){
  for(;;)
    switch(x){
      default:
    }
}

const protected = x, function arguments(){}
      ^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Cannot use this name (protected) as a variable name because: Cannot use this reserved word as a variable name in strict mode

function protected(){
         ^------- error

  for(;;)
    switch(x){
      default:
    }
}

const protected = x, function arguments(){}
`````


### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as strict mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
