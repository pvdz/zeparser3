## Input

`````js
a
-->foo bar baz
b
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    Was looking for a character that starts an expression, found `>` (62 / 0x3e) instead

a
-->foo bar baz
  ^------- error

b
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [web]:

````js
(a);
(b);
````

Produces same AST
