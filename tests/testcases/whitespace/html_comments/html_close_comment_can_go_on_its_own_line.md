## Input

`````js

-->
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    Was looking for a character that starts an expression, found `>` (62 / 0x3e) instead


-->
  ^------- error
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
ast: {
  type: 'Program',
  loc:{start:{line:1,column:0},end:{line:2,column:3},source:''},
  body: []
}

tokens (1x):

`````


## AST Printer

Printer output different from input [web]:

````js

````

Produces same AST
