# ZeParser parser test cases

> The kicker with all these cases is that the trailing comma might not be an error but the parser won't know until the group actually is or is not followed by an arrow.

These cases are automatically extrapolated and written to their own file.
Each case is applied to each test by simply replacing `#` with the actual case.
