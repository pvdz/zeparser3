### Templates

#### as regular property in object

`````js
({#: x});
`````

#### as regular property in arrow

`````js
({#: x}) => x;
`````

#### as regular property in destructuring assignment

`````js
({#: x} = y);
`````

#### as method in obj

`````js
({
  #(){}
});
`````

#### as method in arrow

`````js
({#(){}}) => x;
`````

#### as method in destructuring assignment

`````js
({#(){}} = y);
`````

#### as static method in obj

`````js
({
  static #(){}
});
`````

#### as generator in obj

`````js
({
  * #(){}
});
`````

#### as getter in obj

`````js
({
  get #(){}
});
`````

#### as setter in obj

`````js
({
  set #(x){}
});
`````

#### as async method in obj

`````js
({
  async #(){}
});
`````

#### as async generator in obj

`````js
({
  async * #(){}
});
`````

#### as static getter in obj

`````js
({
  static get #(){}
});
`````

#### as static generator in obj

not because static generator but because static in object

`````js
({
  static * #(){}
});
`````

#### as static setter in obj

`````js
({
  static set #(x){}
});
`````

#### as static async method in obj

`````js
({
  static async #(){}
});
`````

#### as static async generator in obj

note this is because of static, not async generator

`````js
({
  static async * #(){}
});
`````
