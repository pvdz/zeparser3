# ZeParser parser autogenerated test case

- Path: tests/testcases/objects/literals/identifier_method/special_keys/gen/as_static_async_method_in_obj/protected.md

> :: objects : literals : identifier method : special keys : gen : as static async method in obj
>
> ::> protected

## Input


`````js
({
  static async protected(){}
});
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Expected to parse the start of a property but found an unknown modifier

({
  static async protected(){}
         ^------- error

});
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

_Output same as sloppy mode._
