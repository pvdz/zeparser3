## FAIL

## Input

`````js
function f() {
    "use strict";
    "You \077 ok";
}
`````

## Output

_Note: the whole output block is auto-generated. Manual changes will be overwritten!_

Below follow outputs in four parsing modes: sloppy mode, strict mode script goal, module goal, web compat mode (always sloppy).

Note that the output parts are auto-generated by the test runner to reflect actual result.

### Sloppy mode

Parsed with script goal and as if the code did not start with strict mode header.

`````
throws: Tokenizer error!
    Octal escapes are only allowed in sloppy mode with web compat enabled

function f() {
    "use strict";
    "You \077 ok";
    ^------- error

}
`````

### Strict mode

Parsed with script goal but as if it was starting with `"use strict"` at the top.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Module goal

Parsed with the module goal.

_Output same as sloppy mode._

### Web compat mode

Parsed in sloppy script mode but with the web compat flag enabled.

`````
throws: Parser error!
  Octal in directive with strict mode directive or in strict mode is always illegal

function f() {
    "use strict";
    "You \077 ok";
}
^------- error
`````
